# Claim Processing System Prototype

## Overview

The **Claim Processing System** is a monolithic application built with **Spring Boot** using **Maven** as the build tool. The system is designed to process and manage claims efficiently and provides a small prototype of how different components interact in an enterprise-level application.

## Project Structure

The **Claim Processing System** project follows a typical Maven-based Spring Boot application structure. Below is an overview of the important folders and files:

### Directory Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main codebase of the application.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files such as `application.properties` used for setting up properties of tools like Kafka, Redis, etc.
- `src/test/java`: Contains test classes and test cases to ensure code quality and coverage (including SonarQube coverage reports).
- `pom.xml`: Contains dependencies required for the Spring Boot application and Maven build.

### Important Packages and Classes

- **com.claim.demo**: The main package where the application's entry point is defined, including the `main()` method that boots the application.
  
- **com.claim.demo.controller**: Contains REST API controllers. These controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and return the appropriate HTTP responses. The controllers serve as the interface between the frontend and backend services.

- **com.claim.demo.dto**: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are simple objects used for transferring data between processes, primarily between controllers and services. These objects do not contain business logic.

- **com.claim.demo.entity**: Contains entity classes that map to database tables through Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate or JPA. These classes describe the database table structure.

- **com.claim.demo.filter**: Contains filters used in the web layer, such as logging, authentication, and request preprocessing.

- **com.claim.demo.repository**: Contains interfaces extending `JpaRepository` or similar Spring Data interfaces. These repositories provide elegant ways to perform CRUD operations on the database.

- **com.claim.demo.service**: Service classes contain the business logic of the application. Services call the repositories to interact with the database and handle various operations such as claim processing, validation, and approval.

## Features

- **Claim Processing**: The core functionality is centered around processing claims submitted by users.
- **RESTful API**: Provides REST APIs for interacting with the system. The APIs handle incoming claims, validate them, and update their status.
- **Database Integration**: The system integrates with a relational database to persist claim data.
- **Logging**: Utilizes `Log4j2` for logging and monitoring purposes.
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliability.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Java 11 or higher.
2. Maven installed.
3. IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for Java development.
4. A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) set up to persist data.
